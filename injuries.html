    <h1>Most Common Runner Injuries</h1>
    <h2>causes</h2>
    <ul>    
        <li>overuse: you increased your mileage too fast, or increased the amount of workouts too fast, or both</li>
        <li>muscle imbalances/weakness: one or more of your muscles is weak</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>how to fix pain</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>overuse: either take some days off until the pain subsides, or scale back your exercise, making sure at the end of the day your pain doesn't get worse. When increasing mileage or speed again, do it slowly.</li>
        <li>muscle imbalances/weakness: take a few days off, roll out your muscles (the muscle that is painful, or extremely tight), start strengthening that area (don't forget to stretch and roll out too, so it doesn't continue causing the pain)</li>
    </ul>
